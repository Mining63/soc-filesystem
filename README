These are the setup scripts for the Angstrom buildsystem. If you want to (re)build packages or images for Angstrom, this is the thing to use.
The Angstrom buildsystem is using various components from the Yocto Project, most importantly the Openembedded buildsystem, the bitbake task executor and various application and BSP layers.

This Angstrom release (v2013.12) is officially Yocto Project Compatible with the Yocto Project release 1.5 ("Danny").

To configure the scripts and download the build metadata, do:

	$ MACHINE=socfpga_cyclone5 ./oebb.sh config socfpga_cyclone5

You can change the 'socfpga_cyclone5' in the commandline above with socfpga_arria5.

To start a build of the kernel, source the environment file and do:

	$ . environment-angstromv2013.12
	$ MACHINE=socfpga_cyclone5 bitbake linux-altera-ltsi

To build the latest stable kernel, run the following:
    $ export KERNEL_PROVIDER="linux-altera"
    $ export BB_ENV_EXTRAWHITE="${BB_ENV_EXTRAWHITE} KERNEL_PROVIDER"
    $ MACHINE=socfpga_cyclone5 bitbake linux-altera

To build the root file system:


    $ MACHINE=socpfga_cyclone5 bitbake C5
